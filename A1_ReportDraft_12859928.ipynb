        "This paper has described a new approach for face recognition. The main challenge for this technology before is when the extreme variation happens on humans face such as facial expressions and variation of lights. The variation of light not only include the intensity but also the direction of light sources and the number of them. \n",

        "This article is aimed to solve these problems and get a higher accuracy for face recognition. It has discussed four kinds of method, the simplest one is nearest neighbor which has some disadvantages like expensive computational. The second one is eigenfaces. This method reduce the dimension by using PCA techniques. This method has a disadvantage that the scatter being maximized does not only decided by not only between-class scatter but also the within-class scatter. That will cause the point in space would not cluster well. The third one is linear subspaces, this method give a simple classification algorithm to recognize Lambertian surfaces, it seems this method is better than the other two because this method is less affected by light. The last method is fisherfaces which has the lowest error rate in the four methods. This algorithm use FLD can achieve greater between-class scatter and make the classification simplified. However, in this experiment, authors do not process the variation of pose and they assume that the face has been located and aligned within the image. So, I imagine that the experiment can only be done when the experimental environment is suitable. It may not suitable for the natural environment. \n",

        "This paper compared with four existing algorithm of face recognition, also they develop a new face recognition algorithm which is insensitive of variation in lighting and facial expression. I think they have tried a new method, not directly explicitly modeling this deviation, they project the image to a linear subspace. Their projection method is based on Fisher Linear Discriminant and it produces well separated classes in low-dimensional subspace. \n",

        "In my opinion, the main innovation of this article, is authors compared four current methods and try to improve the performance of these algorithm, then give the result to show readers which one is the best algorithm. They compared the algorithms under the variable illumination, to verify that face recognition algorithms will perform better if they exploit the fac hat images at a Lambertian surface lie in a linear subspace. In the experiment, 5 subsets are set as variables, then they performed two experiments on the database, extrapolation and interpolation. With the result, we can see that fisher face is the best algorithm because it has the lowest error rate in the four algorithm and the shortest time cost. They improve the algorithm performance by preprocess the images, such as normalize the images, eliminate the lighting variation.\n",

The reason of it might be this algorithm ignore the nonsignificant portion of the image, so it less affect by the expression. We should also notice that although all algorithm performed better in full face images, fisherface still have a dramatic improvement, they have made a impressive job to improve this algorithm.\n"

        "I think this technique will be develop soon in the future. Because it is fast and easy to check one’s identity. Actually, it has been using on business using and security using, such as attendance in a company and check the personal information in the airport. In this paper, author didn’t give some advises for future using, but they have mentioned something that they imagine, how well would fisherface method perform when it extend to large database. We can see in the paper, fisherface give a dramatically error rate when test with these small database, in future development, testers may use it in a bigger database. In my opinion, if the face recognize can be improved and can be used in nature environment, it my help with criminal detection. If the security camera catch the face of criminal, it can suddenly visit the database of human face in police system and confirm the identity of criminal. If this function can be realize, the number commit can be effectively reduced, it makes crime much more difficult then before, and people will consider more before they crime. Unfortunately, this idea can’t be realized due to the technology reason, but I think it may be realized in the future."
